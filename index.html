        <p>Hey there, I am Alex Shpyrko and I am currently a student at NYU where I study computer science mostly with
            a little finance on the side. During each summer in college I worked as an intern at <a href="https://avispl.com/en/">AVI-SPL</a>, an audio/video solutions company focused on online meetings. I'm interested in computer networking,
            cryptography, and data science. I've also been known to shoot around the rock once in a while.</p>
